The Pupil Analysis GUI is designed to identify the pupil in videos of the eye and to measure pupil radius and position on each video frame. It can also measure frame luminance to enable the use of a blinking light as an alignment signal between videos and other recording systems.
Refer to the user guide for a full walkthrough of how to use the GUI.
