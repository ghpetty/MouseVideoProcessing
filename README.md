This is a series of scripts, functions, and GUI tools for processing videos of mice for neuroscience research. The most fully-developed aspect of this is the Pupil Analysis GUI, which uses built-in MATLAB functions to measure the size of a mouse's pupil from a video. This can be used as a metric of arousal/alertness. This repository features a PDF guide on how to use the pupil GUI. 

I am no longer actively updating this toolbox, but feel free to contact me if you have questions about it.
